Steven Zhang runs ClimateTechList, a job board that tracks thousands of job openings at high impact tech companies, with filterable categories to maximize your job search. With many students interested in the climate space, Steven was able to contextualize what it means to work in climate software, describing the different kinds of companies and how their technological products directly or indirectly result in climate action, providing us with a more nuanced understanding of the climate-tech space. 

Jaime and Jason Curtis are a husband and wife team that run Option Zero, a software consultancy for climate companies and initatives. They provided insightful career advice, comparing both of their career paths since graduating college, and spoke about why they moved from company to company, and then eventually started their own consultancy. They emphasized weighing the costs and benefits of working at large tech companies versus smaller startups, and seeking opportunities based on whether you are interested in gaining mentorship or ownership over your work.`,
