                The Industry Partners Program is a Brown organization under the
                Computer Science Department that connects the Brown CS community
                with industry opportunities. Primarily, we help undergraduate
                students find fulfilling jobs and internships by networking with
                companies, co-hosting recruitment / career education events, and
                sharing helpful resources to democratize access to information.
                We are committed to helping students explore a diverse range of
                opportunities to find what best suits their needs, including
                applications of technology for social good.

                we are a growing team. If you are interested in joining, be sure
